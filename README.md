# CMC API simple ETL
Using CMC API, Python and sqlite i created a simple ETL and created a small database with basic info of the coins.

Learning bit by bit how to extract, transforrm and load into a database data from api or webscraping project.

This time I used SQLite and an API from CoinMarketCap to create a database of unique tokens and have some basic and not
extensive infor about each coin

### [Here is what my thought process and how I did this!](https://medium.com/@obedlaws_logs/3-3-22-extracting-transforming-and-loading-42e104eac3b3)
